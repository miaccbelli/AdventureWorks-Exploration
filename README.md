# AdventureWorks-Exploration

### ABOUT THIS PROJECT
#### I approached this project from AdventureWorks' perspective, simulating the role of a business analyst reporting to a project manager. My focus was on identifying ways to optimize inventory management, gain deeper insights into employee data, and evaluate the success or failure of the products the company offers. 

### THE GOAL
#### To provide useful and meaningful information like trends and patterns with an analysis of why it is important and/or how to improve.

### CHALLENGES & OTHER COMMENTS
#### I didn't run into any significant issues, but I wish I had explored the purchase orders side of the database more. If I were to come back to this project, I would focus on the suppliers, inventory, and sales more.
