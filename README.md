# AdventureWorks-Exploration

### ABOUT THIS PROJECT
#### I wanted to approach this project from AdvetnureWork's perspective as if I were in a managerial position trying to better understand my employees and the success or failure of the products the company offers. I mainly focused on products including purchase orders and inventory, employee and customer information, and sales.

### THE GOAL
#### To provide useful and meaningful information like trends and patterns with an analysis of why it is important or how to improve.

### CHALLENGES & OTHER COMMENTS
#### I didn't run into any significant issues, but I wish I had explored the purchase orders side of the database more. If I were to come back to this project, I would focus on the suppliers, inventory, and sales more.
